      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Hello! I'm Herbert Dunbar Jr., a passionate photographer who loves capturing everyday moments with a creative edge. My journey began with street and nature photography, and I've expanded into portrait and event work as well.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Through this website, I want to showcase the emotion, detail, and story behind each photo I take. Whether itâ€™s the calm of a landscape or the energy of a city street, I aim to make each image meaningful.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Thank you for visiting my photography portfolio. I hope you find inspiration and connection in the images I share.
      </p>
